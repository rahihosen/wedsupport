Where to go for the tests. National Hospital, we provide the best laboratory in Chittagong in this pandemic period.

DIAGNOSIS
SCBUs will be for relatively fewer sick or less premature babies and most will be kept in open beds. Care may include a mattress that monitors your baby's breathing, they are getting oxygen through their nose and may be fed through a nasogastric (NG) tube. 

SAMPLE COLLECTION
Blood - Blood samples (blood vessels, veins, and sometimes arteries) can be collected by a trained phlebotomist (usually a pathologist or nurse).

ETT
Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) is effective in detecting the early symptoms of coronary artery disease through treadmill exercises. Patients' heart rate increases when exercising on a treadmill, the coronary arteries are assessed by looking at changes in the ECG. Although heartbeats in (ECG) patients can detect and demonstrate several abnormalities, ECG does not rule out the possibility of significant coronary artery disease. In this case, the cardiologist can provide more accurate and useful information from the ETT. The cardiologist may suggest useful therapy by monitoring the effect of exercise on blood pressure.

Echo-Cardiography
Electrocardiography or ECG is a cardiovascular system in which the activity of the heart in the human body is electronically determined and recorded with the help of a cardiograph. Cardiographs measure the electrical potential at the surface of the human body and for some time contain a continuous record of the electrical current associated with the activity of the heart muscle. Any abnormality is determined by comparing the records of the test heart with the normal heart. This record is available in the form of a graph.

CT-SCAN
Computerized tomography (CT) combines data from several X-rays to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. It is useful to get the following:
> Soft cells> pelvis> blood vessels> respiratory system> brain> abdomen> bones
CT is often used to diagnose many cancers, such as liver, lung,, and pancreatic cancers. Because the image allows a doctor to confirm the presence and location of a tumor, its size, and how much it affects nearby tissues. Again, a scan of the head can provide important information about the brain, for example, if there is any bleeding.

Ultrasonography
Electrocardiography or ECG is a cardiovascular system in which the activity of the heart in the human body is electronically determined and recorded with the help of a cardiograph. Cardiographs measure the electrical potential at the surface of the human body and for some time contain a continuous record of the electrical current associated with the activity of the heart muscle. Any abnormality is determined by comparing the records of the test heart with the normal heart. This record is available in the form of a graph.

EEG
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain. This test is done to find out the problems related to brain tumors, brain damage from a head injury, brain dysfunction due to various reasons.

ECG-Machine
Electrocardiography or ECG is a cardiovascular system in which the activity of the heart in the human body is electronically determined and recorded with the help of a cardiograph. Cardiographs measure the electrical potential at the surface of the human body and for some time contain a continuous record of the electrical current associated with the activity of the heart muscle. Any abnormality is determined by comparing the records of the test heart with the normal heart. This record is available in the form of a graph.


X-RAY
X-rays are the starting point for diagnosing or screening various health problems, including pneumonia. The use of X-rays has been around since the early 1900s. If you've ever had an X-ray before, you've probably been told to wear an apron or blanket to protect yourself from X-ray radiation. Although conventional X-rays are considered safe, digital X-rays produce 80% less radiation than conventional ones. Moreover, digital X-rays can produce faster and higher quality X-ray images than conventional X-rays. Now let's talk about portable X-rays. Radiography of patients with portable X-ray machines.

ENDOSCOPY
An endoscopy is a procedure that your doctor uses to see and manage internal organs and vessels in your body. ... why do I need an endoscopy? Your doctor will review your symptoms, perform a physical examination and possibly a blood test for uroflowmetry, also called a uroflow test to measure urine flow and force during urination. This is a simple, uncontrolled urine test that is used to diagnose symptoms such as pain during urination or urination.
